# FHIRTOOMOP
## Introduction
FHIR to OMOP is a Software as a Service offering that can be used to convert your
bulk FHIR files to the OMOP format. The service can be accessed and used from the platform https://portal.preview.isccloud.io/cloudservices/services.
In Part 1 of the exercise, the cloud solution will be configured.

The service pulls your Bulk FHIR data from an Amazon S3 bucket and converts it
into OMOP. A FHIR server will be set up in Part 2, and the bulk FHIR coordinator will be configured so that its output is placed in an S3 bucket in Part 3.

Once converted into OMOP, one can either access the converted data directly from the IRIS database or connect the OHDSI tools (such as Atlas and Hades) to the database, which will be done in Part 4.
